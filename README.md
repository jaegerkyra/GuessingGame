# GuessingGame

Based on tutorial in Mike Dane's YouTube video [C++ Tutorial for Beginners - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&t=13427s).

I took it a step further and added the following:
```
- Some inital instructions for gameplay.
- More detailed win/lose messages and also mentioning what the Secret Number was.
```

If I wanted to take the project further, I might try:
```
- Make the Secret Number random each time the game is played for replayability.
- Add a message if an invalid character is entered, such as "R" or "&".
- Challenge myself to rewrite with a Do While loop instead of a While loop.
- Add an option for rematch, rather than having to relaunch to play again.
- Add difficulty levels (easy 1-10; medium 1-25; hard 1-50; spicy 1-200).
- Add hints such as hotter/colder or smaller/larger.
```
